                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I am a web developer working out of Pittsburgh with a background in the I.T field. I have been around computers my entire life. In addition, I have developed a web development skill set that allows me to create projects using modern
                        and industry standard techniques. This allows me to generate exponential value for clients and employers on their investment in me.</p>
                    <h2> Experience </h2>
                    <p>I have worked in many fields that have involved communicating and working in team environments. I find this to one of my strong suites. In development the ability to communicate is essential. It allows for the production of the product
                        to be done in the most seamless professional way possible. This allows me to transition into working with a group of people very efficiently and be productive right away. This ability to communicate can be the difference between
                        a successful project and ones that end up being a flop. </p>
                    <h2> Web Development </h2>
                    <p>The Nature of web development has been something that has been changing greatly over the years. It has gone from the days of just static HTML and CSS to fully built applications involving many different layers of code. These
                        different layers allow everything to work in conjunction with each other and allow the user to have a well-rounded experience. This is why I find web development to be an awesome fit for business. This is due to it allowing businesses
                        of all sizes to have access to their customers like never before. This immersive form of marketing is something every modern business needs to stay competitive in the marketplace. </p>
                    <h2> Skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        I make responsive websites and web applications and backends with cross browser compatibility for mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.
